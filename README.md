# D3 Choropleth

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/d3-tree-map).

## Functionality

This is the [tree map](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-treemap-diagram) project, where I pull data from an API and visualize it in a tree map with the D3 library.

## Thoughts
